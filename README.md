🖼️ Stable Diffusion Text-to-Image Generator

This repository provides a streamlined approach to generating images using the Stable Diffusion model, leveraging the Hugging Face diffusers library for optimized performance on GPUs.

📜 Project Overview
This project uses StabilityAI’s stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 model to transform text prompts into images. The project is structured for efficient memory and computation management by utilizing the torch.float16 precision on CUDA-compatible devices. Designed with simplicity in mind, it allows users to quickly set up and generate images based on their input prompts.

🛠️ Requirements
To run this project, you’ll need:

Python 3.7+
CUDA-enabled GPU for faster processing (recommended for larger image sizes and faster generation times)
📦 Key Libraries
The project relies on the following libraries:

diffusers: Provides the diffusion model pipeline for generating images.
invisible_watermark: Optional library for watermarking generated images to protect proprietary content.
transformers: Hugging Face library for working with pre-trained models.
accelerate: Optimizes multi-GPU training.
safetensors: Ensures efficient and secure loading of model weights.
🚀 Installation Guide
Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local environment.
Install Required Libraries: Install the necessary packages for running the model pipeline.
Set up GPU: Make sure your environment has CUDA enabled to leverage GPU acceleration for faster processing.
📋 Usage Overview
The project allows users to generate images based on simple prompts. Users initialize the model, set the desired prompt, and the model outputs a unique image based on the given text.

Prompting: Customize your prompt to create a variety of unique images.
GPU Optimization: The setup takes advantage of CUDA for faster performance, enabling half-precision (float16) to reduce memory usage.
🖼️ Example Prompt
For instance, a prompt like "random picture of elephant" will generate an image of an elephant. Users can experiment with different prompts to explore the model's capabilities and create customized outputs.

📝 Additional Information
Memory Optimization: The project is configured to run with torch.float16, ideal for users with limited GPU memory.
Compatibility: While GPU acceleration is recommended, the code can be adapted to run on CPU, though performance will be slower.
